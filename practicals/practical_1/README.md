# Code Submission and Grading System Report

## Introduction
This report documents the practical work on the **Code Submission and Grading System**. The system integrates with **GitHub** for code hosting, **Turnitin** for plagiarism detection, and the **University LMS** for grade synchronization. The work involved creating **Use Case Diagrams (UCD), Interaction Diagrams (IoD), and an Interaction Overview Diagram (IoD)** to model the system's functionality and interactions.

## Objectives
The objectives were:
- Analyze system requirements.
- Design and model the system's functionality using **UML diagrams** with **Turnitin (external tool)**.

## Methodology
The work was divided into three tasks:
1. **Interaction Diagram (IoD):** Focused on student-professor interactions.
2. **Use Case Diagram (UCD):** Focused on system functionality.
3. **Interaction Overview Diagram (IoD):** Combined actor interactions and system workflows.

## System Overview
### 1. Interaction Diagram (IoD)
The **Interaction Diagram** focused on the interactions between **Students** and **Professors** during the assignment submission and grading process.

The diagram highlighted decision points such as:
- Is the submission on time?
- Does the code pass automated tests?
- Is plagiarism detected?

### 2. Use Case Diagram (UCD)
The **Use Case Diagram** focused on the system's functional requirements and use cases. 
The diagram also showed **relationships between use cases and actors**.

### 3. Interaction Overview Diagram (IoD)
The **Interaction Overview Diagram** combined the **actor-to-actor interactions** and **system-supported functionalities** to show the complete workflow.

The diagram included decision points such as:
- Is the submission on time?
- Does the code pass the tests?
- Is plagiarism detected?
- Are the grades approved?

## Conclusion
The practical work successfully modeled the **Code Submission and Grading System** using **UCD, IoD, and Interaction Overview Diagrams**. The diagrams provide a **clear and coherent representation** of the system's functionality, interactions, and workflow. This work lays a **strong foundation** for further system development.
